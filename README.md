## Scientific Calculator fx35A


</div>

### Description

To execute various mathematical calculations including basic operations, advanced operations, statistical operations, trigonometric operations and the ability to switch between 4 different modes.
 
### More Info
 
Any real numbers with maximum 15 digits. In case of scientific notation the range is from -99 to 99 inclusive.

The calculator only works with real numbers, not complex ones. Also, when loaded, some controls (particularly command buttons) on the form might appear blank. In such case the user will have to alter the colour of some of the controls to be able to see them.

Results of the calculations mentioned above.

Fractions do not work, because I couldn't come up with a good solution. Also, there could be some minor errors with scientific notation. In general the code might be too complicated. If anybody has a better solution to any of my modules, please send it to me at foxdetective007@mailcity.com
